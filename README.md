# ArithmeticArrange

I am trying to make a time calculator for freecodecamp's Python tutorial.

"Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

* Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

I managed to do the example project thanks to Faraday Academy's explanation. I had some errors directly adapting, so fixed some parts on my own.
